<center><h5>THE OPEN SOURCE SECURITY FOUNDATION (OPENSSF)</h5></center>
<center><h6>Participation Agreement</h6></center>

Thank you for your interest in joining the Open Source Security Foundation (the "OpenSSF"), a project of The Linux Foundation (the "LF"). The mission of the OpenSSF is to inspire and enable the community to secure the open source software we all depend on, including development, testing, fundraising, infrastructure, and support initiatives driven by Working Groups and Projects (each a "Technical Initiative"). The governance for the OpenSSF will operate pursuant to the OpenSSF Charter (the "Charter"), set forth as [Exhibit B](#exb), and as amended in the future by the OpenSSF's Governing Board with the approval of the LF. **Please note** that you must be a member of the LF to be eligible to participate as a member of the OpenSSF. For further information, visit the [Corporate Membership](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/membership/join/) page at the LF web site.

Participants will enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in the Charter and will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the OpenSSF's Governing Board may from time to time adopt with notice to members. The LF reserves the right to refuse any Participation Agreement submitted by a member who has apayment obligations outstanding to the LF or to any other LF projectdirected funds. Technical oversight governance for any Technical Initiative is set forth in the applicable charter for each such Technical Initiative.

Please have this Participation Agreement (the "Agreement") executed by an authorized representative of the member company named below ("Member") and send a copy in PDF form by email to [membership\@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:membership@linuxfoundation.org). A countersigned copy will be returned to you by email for your records when your eligibility for membership has been confirmed and an invoice will be emailed to you if any payment of applicable membership fees is required. Note that this is not an indication of interest; execution of this Agreement creates an irrevocable, binding obligation for the member company to make the payments provided for and to otherwise perform in accordance with its terms.

**Contact Information**

If you are an existing LF Member, all legal, billing and financial notices from the LF relating to your participation will be sent to the individuals already on file with the LF under those categories unless you designate a different individual in [Exhibit A](#exa).

**Membership Term**

Membership will begin on acceptance as a member and the initial membership term will continue until the first anniversary of membership. At the first anniversary of membership, if membership is not canceled at least thirty days prior to the first anniversary of membership, the second membership term will be prorated for the remainder of that calendar year (a "stub period"), bringing the membership term inline with a calendar year cycle starting at the first anniversary of membership. The OpenSSF does not plan to require any participation fees during the initial membership term. Any participation fees instituted by the Governing Board at a later time will be invoiced according to each annual membership term or prorated for a stub period.

**General Membership Terms**

Agreements completed and accepted before the 15th of the month will begin the membership term as if active on the first day of the month of signature. Agreements signed on or after the 15th of the month will begin the membership term as if active on the 1st day of the following month. We reserve the right to refuse your Participation Agreement if you have outstanding obligations to the LF or any other LF projects. In no event will fees be refunded, upon a Member's resignation or otherwise.

Each Member acknowledges that the LF and other members of the OpenSSF depend upon reliable renewal information to budget effectively, and that the LF's ability to provide services to the OpenSSF would suffer in the event of nonpayment of your LF membership fees. Each Member acknowledges The Linux Foundation's Good Standing Policy, available at https://www.linuxfoundation.org/good-standing-policy.

Membership in the OpenSSF will renew annually for successive terms,unless written notice of non-renewal is delivered to the LF on or before December 1 of the current membership year.

      </ol>
  </ol>

7. **Voting**
<ol type="a">
  <li>Quorum for Governing Board, Committee, and TAC meetings will require at least fifty percent of the voting representatives in good standing.

</br><ol type="i">
      <li>A voting representative must have attended two of the preceding three meetings to be counted as in good standing for the purposes of Quorum. Voting rights will be reinstated at the meeting after the voting representative has attended two of the prior three meetings.</li></ol>
</br>
      <li>Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus. If, however, any decision requires a vote to move forward, the voting representatives will vote on a one vote per voting representative basis.</li>
</br>
      <li>Except as provided in Section 15.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote at a meeting will require a simple majority vote, provided quorum is met. Except as provided in Section 15.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by electronic vote without a meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.</li>
</br>
      <li>In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that  cannot be resolved by the TAC, the TAC Representative may refer the matter to the Governing Board. In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the Governing Board, the chairperson may refer the matter to the LF for assistance in facilitating a decision.</li>
      </ol>

8. **Subsidiaries and Related Companies**
<ol type="a">
  <li>Definitions:
</br>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>"Subsidiaries" means any entity in which a Member owns, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting securities or voting membership interests of the entity in question;</li>
</br>
      <li>"Related Company" means any entity which controls or is controlled by a Member or which, together with a Member, is under the common control of a third party, in each case where such control results from ownership, either directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent of the voting securities or voting membership interests of the entity in question; and</li>
</br>
      <li>"Related Companies" are entities that are each a Related  Company of a Member.</li></ol>
</br>
    <li> Only the legal entity which has executed a Participation Agreement and its Subsidiaries will be entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of such OpenSSF Membership. </li>
</br>
    <li>If a OpenSSF Member is itself a foundation, association, consortium, open source project, membership organization, user group or other entity that has members or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such OpenSSF Member will extend only to the employee-representatives of such OpenSSF Member, and not to its members or sponsors, unless otherwise approved by the Governing Board in a specific case.</li>
</br>
    <li>OpenSSF Membership is non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except a OpenSSF Member may transfer its current OpenSSF Membership benefits and obligations to a successor of substantially all of its business or assets, whether by merger, sale or otherwise; provided that the transferee agrees to be bound by this Charter and the Bylaws and policies required by LF membership.</li></ol>

10. **Trademarks**
<ol type="a">
  <li>

  Any trademarks relating to the OpenSSF or a Technical Initiative, including without limitation any mark relating to any Conformance Program, must be transferred to and held by the Linux Foundation or one of its affiliates and available for use pursuant to the trademark usage policy of the Linux Foundation (available at [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage) or such affiliate.</li></ol>

11. **Antitrust Guidelines**
<ol type="a">
  <li>
  
  All Members must abide by The Linux Foundation's Antitrust Policy available at [http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy). </li>
    <li>All Members must encourage open participation from any  organization able to meet the membership requirements, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Governing Board will not seek to exclude any member based on any criteria, requirements or reasons other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all members.</li></ol>

12. **Budget**
<ol type="a">
  <li>If the OpenSSF decides to raise funds, the Governing Board will
        approve an annual budget and never commit to spend in excess of funds raised. The budget and the purposes to which it is applied must be consistent with both (a) the non-profit and tax-exempt mission of the Linux Foundation and (b) the aggregate goals of the Technical Initiatives.</li>
        </br>
  <li>The Linux Foundation will provide the Governing Board with regular reports of spend levels against the budget. Under no circumstances will the Linux Foundation have any expectation or obligation to undertake an action on behalf of the OpenSSF or otherwise related to the OpenSSF that is not covered in full by funds raised by the OpenSSF.</li>
        </br>
  <li>In the event an unbudgeted or otherwise unfunded obligation arises related to the OpenSSF, the Linux Foundation will coordinate with the Governing Board to address gap funding requirements.</li></ol>

13. **General & Administrative Expenses**
<ol type="a">
  <li>The Linux Foundation will have custody of and final authority over the usage of any fees, funds and other cash receipts.</li>
        </br>

The G&A fee will be 9% of the OpenSSF's first \$1,000,000 of gross receipts each year and 6% of the OpenSSF's gross receipts each year over \$1,000,000. Individual Technical Initiative funding arrangements may be setup under alternative arrangements by approval of the Governing Board and the Linux Foundation.</li></ol>

14. **General Rules and Operations. The OpenSSF activities must:**
<ol type="a">
  <li>engage in the work of the project in a professional manner consistent with maintaining a cohesive community, while also maintaining the goodwill and esteem of the Linux Foundation in the open source community;</li>
        </br>
  <li>respect the rights of all trademark owners, including any branding and usage guidelines;</li>
        </br>
